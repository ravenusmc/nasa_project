# NASA Project
## Intro

The purpose of this project is use some NASA/space api's and build a site that has a lot of information 
about the cosmos. I recently finished reading The Human Cosmos: Civilization and the Stars, which was a great 
book, and maybe that inspired me to build this page. 

This project is also a little bit different from my other projects. Some of this code I took from Team Treehouse
when I was doing a JavaScript lesson with them. The project covered a space project so I decided that 
it would be good to use that code within this project.
